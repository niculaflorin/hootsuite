homework

I'd used Flask (for python) and MongoDB (for the database)
For the first method (trans1) I'm inserting data into database with a HTML form (add.html) 
In the second method (trans2) the user is sender or the receiver, timestamp is the day and suma is the 
threshold. The cursor is the query for the database and in the final part I'm displaying the result.
In the third method (balance) in the cursor is the query for the database. In the loop am parsing the result
into a json and adding the 'suma' field to balance.
